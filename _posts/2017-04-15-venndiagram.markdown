## The Campaign

Here is a campaign I think many of us can support.  Cannabis is legal in more US states than not and more states are [legalizing it all the time.](https://thecannabisindustry.org/state-marijuana-policies-map/)


Dispensaries and other legal cannabis businesses are having a hell of a time.  Very few can get bank accounts. If they can get a bank and take credit cards, they either bounce from one merchant to the next or pay huge fees and have high reserve requirements.  What this means to most of us is that you can't pay in electronically for your product.

If you fall into any of the intersections in the Venn diagram above, do us a favor.  Ask the store where you buy your product to accept cryptocurrency.  If they contact us and mention "BTCCO" they will be able to get a nice discount on our software. If you tweet the name of the dispensary along with #BTCCO and they buy our software, we will send you a small gift of bitcoin!* 

We are striving to change the way eCommerce works.  Moving the world from complicated, proprietary, insecure networks like SWIFT, Visa/ Mastercard to open, secure systems will improve all commerce and make it less expensive and risky.  


Oh - and if you want to ask the rest of the retail establishments you frequent if they will accept bitcoin the same deal applies.  I guess that means we should change the Venn diagram to be bigger.

### Getting Setup

Just in case you are reading this and have not set up a Cryptocurrency wallet or hooked up with an exchange yet.  My personal favorite (unless you live in Hawaii) is [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/58e2e78593138000b551aba6) its easy to use and -- best of all -- allows you to buy Bitcoin or Ether with a credit card really quickly.  Its like recharging your StarBucks App.
Another great option (for those in Hawaii like me especially) is [Uphold](https://uphold.com).
